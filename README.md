# CSS Image Editor

This is a basic image editor built with AngularJS that lets you check out the CSS filter property and build cool effects yourself quickly and easily. It provides you with the CSS needed to achieve your affect in realtime so you can copy it out and use it in your project.

## Usage

Simple! Just slide the sliders around (or enter values manually) to achieve your desired effect. See how the different CSS filters interact with one another.
I've also included a few Instagram-esque examples of what is possible.
